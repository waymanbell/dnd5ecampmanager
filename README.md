Baby steps!  I've managed to get the bot to connect to my Discord and respond to a limited number of commands.
There is virtually no input sterilization, and it falls over at a slight breeze, but it works so long as 
participants understand and adhere to its limitations.

Commands that work so far:

!hello - Responds with Hello
!showmewhatyougot - Displays the raw message data
!goaway - Disconnects the bot
!roll AdB - Rolls A-quanity of B-sided dice, displays the rolls and the total.
!roll AdB-C - As above, subtracts C-modifier from total
!roll AdB+C - As above, adds C-modifier to total
